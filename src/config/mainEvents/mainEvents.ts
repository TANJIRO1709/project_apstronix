    description:
      "Stellar Challenge (A Satellite in distress):  This event poses an exciting challenge and aims to kindle the minds of participants by capturing their interest in satellite and space technology by posing different challenges and riddles in the spirit of repairing a satellite back to an operational state.  The event will commence with a short orientation, where participants will be introduced to the contest, its spirit, and the rules of engagement. As the session concludes, the first challenge awaits them—a riddle composed of simple yet clever questions. Hidden within the answers lies a clue, and only those who think carefully will uncover the set of coordinates leading them to the next destination.  At this location, a QR code will be revealed. Scanning it transports participants into a virtual scenario, where an astronaut in distress seeks their help. To advance further, the teams must solve a puzzle within this interactive setup. Those who succeed in aiding the astronaut will earn their passage into the final round.  In the concluding stage, a payload box will be presented. The task is deceptively simple: make the necessary adjustments so that the payload remains balanced and stable within a threaded hook mechanism. Precision, ingenuity, and quick thinking will determine the outcome. The participants who manage to stabilize the payload will emerge as the winners of the challenge, proving their wit and problem-solving ability in true Parikramaka spirit.  For the successful conduct of the event “Stellar Challenge (A Satellite in Distress)”, we will require either two rooms or one room along with an open space. The first space will be used for the orientation and riddle-solving session, while the second space is needed for the QR-based puzzle round and the final payload box activity, which involves free movement and setup. Having these two separate areas will ensure smooth execution of the event, avoid crowding, and provide participants with an engaging and immersive experience. ",
